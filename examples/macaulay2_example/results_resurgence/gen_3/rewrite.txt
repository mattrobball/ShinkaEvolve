-- Jacobian Star Configuration Generator
-- Generates the ideal of points dual to an arrangement of lines (Star Configuration)
-- This approach avoids manual point entry and scales to configurations with high resurgence

R = QQ[x,y]

-- Define a set of 6 lines in affine space with distinct slopes to avoid parallelism.
-- These lines are chosen to be in general position (no 3 intersect at a point).
-- A star configuration of d lines in P^2 creates d(d-1)/2 points.
-- For d=6, we get 15 points.
L = {
    x,
    y,
    x + y - 1,
    x - y - 1,
    2*x + y - 5,
    x + 2*y - 7
}

-- Construct the defining polynomial of the line arrangement
F = product L

-- The ideal of the point configuration is the singular locus of the curve F=0
-- For lines in general position, this locus consists of the pairwise intersection points (nodes).
-- We define J as the Jacobian ideal plus the ideal of F itself.
J = ideal(diff(x,F), diff(y,F)) + ideal(F)

-- We take the radical to ensure we have the ideal of the reduced points.
-- The resulting ideal I represents the Star Configuration of 15 points.
I = radical J
