 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

--- Define the ideal of a point configuration
--- Using points of multiplicity >= 3 from the B3 arrangement (signed permutations)
--- These 7 points are highly special (intersections of 4 lines each from the arrangement)

+-- Strategy: Construct a Star Configuration of s=5 lines.
+-- The points are the pairwise intersections of these lines (binom(5,2) = 10 points).
+-- The ideal I is generated by the partial derivatives of the product of the linear forms.
+-- For s=5, the expected resurgence is 2(s-1)/s = 8/5 = 1.6.
+-- This is strictly greater than 1.5, so we expect I^(3) not in I^2.

+-- Define 5 lines in general position.
+-- We use coefficients that ensure no three lines are concurrent.
