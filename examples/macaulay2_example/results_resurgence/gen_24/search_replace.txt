</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Replace the Fermat configuration (resurgence 1.5) with a Star Configuration of 6 lines in general position.
Star configurations in $\mathbb{P}^2$ formed by $s$ lines have resurgence $2(s-1)/s$.
For $s=6$, the resurgence is $10/6 \approx 1.67$, which is higher than the Fermat configuration.
We construct the configuration using 6 lines defined by parameters $t \in \{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, 3\}$ applied to the form $x + ty + t^2z$. The choice of $t$ ensures general position (no three lines are concurrent) via the Vandermonde determinant.
The ideal is efficiently generated by products of 5 lines. This configuration should exhibit containment failures such as $I^{(5)} \not\subseteq I^3$ or $I^{(8)} \not\subseteq I^5$, providing a higher resurgence lower bound.
