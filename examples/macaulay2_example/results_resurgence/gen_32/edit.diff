 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties

 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence

--- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
--- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
--- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
--- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
--- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence

+-- Strategy: Construct the configuration of points defined by the singular locus
+-- of the Type B3 reflection arrangement.
+-- The arrangement consists of 9 lines: x=0, y=0, z=0, x=±y, x=±z, y=±z.
+-- The polynomial defining the union of these lines is Q.
+-- The singular locus (points where at least 2 lines meet) creates a configuration
+-- with points of multiplicity 4, 3, and 2.
+-- These mixed high multiplicities are key for creating containment failures.
 
--- Instantiate the configuration with n=4
--- This defines a set of 19 points in P^2 (3 coordinate points + 16 points with non-zero coordinates)
--- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^4=y^4, y^4=z^4, z^4=x^4
