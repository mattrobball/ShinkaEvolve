<DESCRIPTION>
I will replace the Fermat configuration with a "Star Configuration" of 6 lines in P^2.
A star configuration of s lines consists of the set of pairwise intersection points of s linear forms in general position.
It is a known result in commutative algebra that the resurgence of the ideal of a star configuration of s lines in P^2 is exactly 2(s-1)/s.
For s=6, the resurgence is 2(5)/6 = 5/3 ≈ 1.667.
This is significantly higher than the resurgence of the Fermat configuration (1.5) or the generic case (1.0).
This should produce containment failures for ratios up to ~1.67, maximizing the resurgence score.
I will define the 6 lines in general position and construct the ideal, which is generated by the products of any 5 of the 6 linear forms.

-- The Fermat configuration of 12 points in P^2
-- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^3-y^3, y^3-z^3, z^3-x^3
-- This configuration is known to provide a counterexample to I^(3) <= I^2

-- Star configuration of 6 lines in P^2
-- Defined by 6 linear forms in general position.
-- The points are the pairwise intersections of these lines (15 points).
-- The ideal is generated by the products of any 5 of these forms.
-- Theoretical resurgence is 2(6-1)/6 = 5/3 approx 1.667.
