fermat_configuration_12_points
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Replace the simple square configuration with the Fermat configuration of 12 points in projective space. This configuration is the set of intersection points of the dual Hesse arrangement (defined by x^3-y^3=0, etc.) and is a celebrated counterexample to the containment I^(3) subset I^2, providing a resurgence of at least 1.5. The ideal is generated by three forms of degree 4.

-- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
-- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

R = QQ[x,y]

-- Define the ideal of a point configuration
-- Starting with a simple configuration - evolution should find better ones
-- Example: 4 points forming a square
pts = {
    ideal(x, y),           -- origin
    ideal(x-1, y),         -- (1,0)
    ideal(x, y-1),         -- (0,1)
    ideal(x-1, y-1)        -- (1,1)
}

-- The ideal I is the intersection of the point ideals
I = intersect pts

-- The Fermat configuration of 12 points in P^2
-- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^3-y^3, y^3-z^3, z^3-x^3
-- This configuration is known to provide a counterexample to I^(3) <= I^2
I = ideal(
    x*(y^3-z^3),
    y*(z^3-x^3),
