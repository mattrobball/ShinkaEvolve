 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

--- Define the ideal of a point configuration
--- Using a Star Configuration of 4 generic lines in P^2
--- The star configuration of s lines has resurgence (s-1)/(s-2)
--- For s=4, resurgence is 1.5, which should produce containment failures for m/r < 1.5

+-- Define the ideal of a point configuration using a line arrangement polynomial.
+-- We target the Star Configuration of 3 lines (s=3), which is known to have
+-- a resurgence of (s-1)/(s-2) = 2/1 = 2.
+-- This is higher than the s=4 case (rho=1.5) or Hessian arrangements.
+-- The polynomial F defines the union of 3 lines: x=0, y=0, z=0.
+F = x*y*z

+-- The singular locus of this arrangement consists of the pairwise intersection points.
+-- For F = xyz, the singular locus is given by the Jacobian ideal.
+-- J = (yz, xz, xy)
+-- The points are (1:0:0), (0:1:0), (0:0:1).
+J = ideal jacobian ideal F
