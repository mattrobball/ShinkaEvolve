 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

--- Define the ideal of a point configuration
--- Using the singular locus of the B3 reflection arrangement (9 lines)
--- Lines: x, y, z, x+/-y, x+/-z, y+/-z
--- This arrangement creates points with high multiplicity (up to 4 lines intersecting)
--- Such configurations (rational points of high multiplicity arrangements) often have high resurgence
