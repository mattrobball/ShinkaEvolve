 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence
 
 R = QQ[x,y,z]
 
 -- Star configuration of 6 lines in P^2
 -- The points are the pairwise intersections of 6 generic lines.
--- This configuration (15 points) is known to have resurgence 2(6-1)/6 = 5/3 approx 1.67,
--- which is higher than the 1.5 of the Fermat configuration.

 -- Define 6 generic linear forms.
 -- We use coefficients based on powers to ensure no three lines intersect at a point (genericity).
