 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

--- The Fermat configuration of 12 points in P^2
--- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^3-y^3, y^3-z^3, z^3-x^3

+-- This configuration (intersections of pairs of 7 lines) has 21 points.
