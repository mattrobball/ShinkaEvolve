<DESCRIPTION>
Switch from a star configuration of 4 lines to 5 lines. Star configurations of s lines generally have resurgence values that increase with s (specifically 2(s-1)/s for points in P2). For s=5, the expected resurgence is 1.6, which allows for the detection of the containment failure I^(3) not in I^2 (ratio 1.5). This failure is a key target for maximizing the score as it represents a high resurgence.

-- Using a Star Configuration of 5 generic lines in P^2
-- The star configuration of s lines is expected to have higher resurgence for larger s.
-- For s=5, theoretical resurgence is 1.6, which allows for containment failures such as I^(3) not in I^2.
