 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence

--- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
--- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
--- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
--- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
--- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence

+-- Star configuration of 5 lines in general position
+-- The ideal of the star configuration is the ideal of the pairwise intersection points of s lines.
+-- For generic lines, this is given by the Jacobian ideal of the product of the linear forms.
+-- Star configurations are known to maximize resurgence; for 5 lines, we expect rho(I) > 1.5.
 
--- Instantiate the configuration with n=4
--- This defines a set of 19 points in P^2 (3 coordinate points + 16 points with non-zero coordinates)
--- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^4=y^4, y^4=z^4, z^4=x^4
