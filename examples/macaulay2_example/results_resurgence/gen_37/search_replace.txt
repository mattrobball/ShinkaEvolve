star_configuration_5_lines
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I propose to replace the Fermat configuration with a "Star Configuration" of 5 lines in general position. The ideal of a star configuration of $s$ lines is defined as the intersection of the ideals of the pairwise intersection points of the lines. For lines in general position, this ideal is generated by the partial derivatives of the product of the linear forms defining the lines (the Jacobian ideal).

Star configurations are extremal objects in the study of symbolic powers and containment. Specifically, for a star configuration of $s$ lines in $\mathbb{P}^2$, the resurgence is known to be related to the ratio $s/(s-1)$ or higher depending on the definition, and often provides counterexamples or tight bounds for containment conjectures. For $s=5$, the configuration consists of 10 points (the intersection of 5 lines). This configuration is expected to show high resurgence, potentially exceeding the $1.5$ obtained from the Fermat/Dual Hesse configuration.

R = QQ[x,y,z]

-- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
-- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
-- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
-- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
-- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence
fermatIdeal = (n) -> (
    ideal(
        x*(y^n - z^n),
        y*(z^n - x^n),
        z*(x^n - y^n)
    )
)

-- Instantiate the configuration with n=4
-- This defines a set of 19 points in P^2 (3 coordinate points + 16 points with non-zero coordinates)
-- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^4=y^4, y^4=z^4, z^4=x^4
I = fermatIdeal(4)

-- Derive the points from the ideal for completeness
-- decompose returns the prime components (points) of the ideal

R = QQ[x,y,z]

-- Star configuration of 5 lines in general position
-- The ideal of the star configuration is the ideal of the pairwise intersection points of s lines.
-- For generic lines, this is given by the Jacobian ideal of the product of the linear forms.
-- Star configurations are known to maximize resurgence; for 5 lines, we expect rho(I) > 1.5.

-- Define 5 lines in general position (no 3 concurrent)
L1 = x
L2 = y
L3 = z
L4 = x + y + z
L5 = x + 2*y + 3*z

-- The defining polynomial of the arrangement (product of lines)
F = L1 * L2 * L3 * L4 * L5

-- The ideal I of the configuration (singular locus of the union of lines)
-- Since no 3 lines are concurrent, the singular locus consists exactly of the 10 pairwise intersections.
-- The Jacobian ideal defines this locus.
I = trim ideal(diff(x,F), diff(y,F), diff(z,F))

-- Derive the points from the ideal for completeness
-- decompose returns the prime components (points) of the ideal
