star_config_5_lines
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Replace the B3 configuration with a Star Configuration of 5 lines in P^2.
The configuration consists of 10 points, which are the pairwise intersections of 5 lines in general position (no 3 concurrent).
Lines chosen: x, y, z, x+y+z, x+2y+5z.
Star configurations with s=5 are known to have resurgence rho = 1.6, which guarantees the containment failure I^(3) not in I^2 (ratio 1.5 < 1.6).
This should significantly increase the resurgence lower bound score.
