</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I propose to evaluate the point configuration formed by the singular locus of a specific line arrangement: a 3x3 grid of lines combined with the two main diagonals.
This arrangement is defined by the polynomial $F = (x^3 - xz^2)(y^3 - yz^2)(x^2 - y^2)$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$.
It consists of 8 lines: three vertical ($x=0, x=z, x=-z$), three horizontal ($y=0, y=z, y=-z$), and two diagonal ($x=y, x=-y$).
The singular locus contains points where 2, 3, or 4 lines intersect.
Configurations with high multiplicity intersections (like star configurations or this grid) are known to exhibit high resurgence.
Specifically, the point $(0:0:1)$ is an intersection of 4 lines ($x=0, y=0, x=y, x=-y$), and points like $(1:1:1)$ are intersections of 3 lines.
This heterogeneity and high multiplicity often leads to containment failures $I^{(m)} \not\subset I^r$ for ratios $m/r$ significantly greater than 1.
I define the ideal $I$ as the radical of the Jacobian ideal of $F$, computed by intersecting the prime components found via decomposition.

R = QQ[x,y,z]

-- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
-- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
-- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
-- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
-- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence
fermatIdeal = (n) -> (
    ideal(
        x*(y^n - z^n),
        y*(z^n - x^n),
        z*(x^n - y^n)
    )
)

-- Instantiate the configuration with n=4
-- This defines a set of 19 points in P^2 (3 coordinate points + 16 points with non-zero coordinates)
-- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^4=y^4, y^4=z^4, z^4=x^4
I = fermatIdeal(4)

-- Derive the points from the ideal for completeness
-- decompose returns the prime components (points) of the ideal

R = QQ[x,y,z]

-- Define a line arrangement consisting of a 3x3 grid plus diagonals
-- The polynomial F defines the union of 8 lines:
-- x=0, x=z, x=-z (from x^3-xz^2)
-- y=0, y=z, y=-z (from y^3-yz^2)
-- y=x, y=-x      (from x^2-y^2)
F = (x^3 - x*z^2) * (y^3 - y*z^2) * (x^2 - y^2)

-- The singular locus of this arrangement consists of points where >= 2 lines intersect
-- High multiplicity intersections (up to 4 lines at the origin) drive up resurgence
-- We calculate the Jacobian ideal
J = ideal(diff(x,F), diff(y,F), diff(z,F))

-- We obtain the ideal of the points by taking the radical of the Jacobian
-- In this case, we decompose to find the prime ideals of the points and intersect them
-- This ensures I is the radical ideal of the configuration
pts = decompose J
I = intersect pts
