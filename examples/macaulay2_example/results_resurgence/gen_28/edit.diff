 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

--- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
--- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
--- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
--- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
--- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence

--- Instantiate the configuration with n=4

+-- We obtain the ideal of the points by taking the radical of the Jacobian
+-- In this case, we decompose to find the prime ideals of the points and intersect them
