 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties

 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

--- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
--- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
--- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
--- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
--- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence

+-- Construct a Star Configuration of 7 lines in P^2
+-- A star configuration of s lines consists of the pairwise intersection points of the lines.
+-- We choose 7 lines in general position (no 3 concurrent).
+-- We use the moment curve L_t = x + t*y + t^2*z to ensure general position.
+-- For a star configuration of s lines, the resurgence is 2(s-1)/s.
+-- For s=7, rho(I) = 12/7 approx 1.714.
+-- This should create failures for I^(5) subset I^3 (ratio 1.667 < 1.714).
