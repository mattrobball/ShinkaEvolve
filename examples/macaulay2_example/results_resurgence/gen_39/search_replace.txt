star_configuration_7_lines

<DESCRIPTION>
The previous best result was obtained with a Fermat-type configuration which achieved a resurgence of at least 1.5. To improve this, I propose using a Star Configuration of 7 lines in general position. Star configurations of $s$ lines are known to have resurgence $\rho(I) = \frac{2(s-1)}{s}$. For $s=7$, this yields $\rho(I) = 12/7 \approx 1.714$. This higher resurgence ceiling should allow for detecting additional containment failures, specifically $I^{(5)} \not\subset I^3$ (since $5/3 \approx 1.667 < 1.714$), which was a passing case in previous iterations. The lines are constructed using the dual moment curve to guarantee general position (no 3 lines concurrent) with rational coefficients.

-- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
-- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
-- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
-- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
-- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence
fermatIdeal = (n) -> (
    ideal(
        x*(y^n - z^n),

-- Instantiate the configuration with n=4
-- This defines a set of 19 points in P^2 (3 coordinate points + 16 points with non-zero coordinates)
-- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^4=y^4, y^4=z^4, z^4=x^4
I = fermatIdeal(4)

-- Derive the points from the ideal for completeness
-- decompose returns the prime components (points) of the ideal

R = QQ[x,y,z]

-- Construct a Star Configuration of 7 lines in P^2
-- A star configuration of s lines consists of the pairwise intersection points of the lines.
-- We choose 7 lines in general position (no 3 concurrent).
-- We use the moment curve L_t = x + t*y + t^2*z to ensure general position.
-- For a star configuration of s lines, the resurgence is 2(s-1)/s.
-- For s=7, rho(I) = 12/7 approx 1.714.
-- This should create failures for I^(5) subset I^3 (ratio 1.667 < 1.714).
