--- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
--- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
--- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
--- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
--- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence

+-- Strategy: Construct a Star Configuration of 7 lines in general position.
+-- A star configuration of s lines consists of the binom(s,2) pairwise intersection points.
+-- The resurgence of the ideal of these points is known to be rho(I) = 2(s-1)/s.
+-- For s=7, rho = 12/7 approx 1.714. This is higher than the Fermat configuration (1.5).
+-- We expect this to trigger containment failures for ratios m/r < 1.714, 
+-- specifically I^(5) not contained in I^3 (ratio 1.667).
 
--- Instantiate the configuration with n=4
--- This defines a set of 19 points in P^2 (3 coordinate points + 16 points with non-zero coordinates)
--- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^4=y^4, y^4=z^4, z^4=x^4

+-- The ideal of a star configuration of s lines is generated by the products of any s-1 forms.
