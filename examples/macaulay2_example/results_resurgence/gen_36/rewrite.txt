-- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
-- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

R = QQ[x,y,z]

-- Strategy: Construct a Star Configuration of 7 lines in general position.
-- A star configuration of s lines consists of the binom(s,2) pairwise intersection points.
-- The resurgence of the ideal of these points is known to be rho(I) = 2(s-1)/s.
-- For s=7, rho = 12/7 approx 1.714. This is higher than the Fermat configuration (1.5).
-- We expect this to trigger containment failures for ratios m/r < 1.714, 
-- specifically I^(5) not contained in I^3 (ratio 1.667).

-- Define 7 linear forms using the moment curve (1, t, t^2) to ensure general position.
-- We use integer values for t from 0 to 6. The Vandermonde determinant ensures 
-- that no three lines are concurrent (i.e., generic arrangement).
forms = apply(0..6, t -> x + t*y + t^2*z)

-- The ideal of a star configuration of s lines is generated by the products of any s-1 forms.
-- For s=7, the ideal is generated by the products of any 6 forms.
-- We compute these generators efficiently by taking the product of all 7 forms (P)
-- and dividing by each form L_i individually.
P = product forms
I = ideal apply(forms, f -> P // f)

-- Derive the points from the ideal for completeness.
-- This decomposes the ideal into the 21 prime ideals corresponding to the points.
