star_config_5_lines
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I propose to replace the Fermat configuration with a star configuration of 5 generic lines in P^2.
The Fermat configuration (12 points) has a resurgence of 1.5. A star configuration of d lines in P^2 has a resurgence of 2d/(d+1) for odd d. For d=5, this gives 10/6 = 5/3 ≈ 1.67.
This higher resurgence should lead to a containment failure for I^(5) ⊆ I^3 (ratio 1.667), improving upon the max failure ratio of 1.5 from the Fermat configuration.
The configuration consists of 10 points, formed by the pairwise intersections of 5 lines: x, y, z, x+y+z, and x+2y+3z. The integer coefficients are chosen to ensure no three lines are concurrent (generic star configuration).

-- The Fermat configuration of 12 points in P^2
-- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^3-y^3, y^3-z^3, z^3-x^3
-- This configuration is known to provide a counterexample to I^(3) <= I^2

    x*(y^3-z^3),
