<DESCRIPTION>
Implement a Star Configuration of 6 generic lines in P^2.
Star configurations of s lines are known to have resurgence rho = (s-1)/2.
For s=6, this yields rho = 2.5, which is significantly higher than the previous 1.5.
We construct the lines using a Vandermonde matrix approach (x + t*y + t^2*z) to guarantee no three lines are concurrent (general position).
The ideal is the intersection of the ideals of the 15 intersection points.

-- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
-- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
-- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
-- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
-- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence
fermatIdeal = (n) -> (
    ideal(
        x*(y^n - z^n),
        y*(z^n - x^n),
        z*(x^n - y^n)
    )
)

-- Instantiate the configuration with n=4
-- This defines a set of 19 points in P^2 (3 coordinate points + 16 points with non-zero coordinates)
-- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^4=y^4, y^4=z^4, z^4=x^4
I = fermatIdeal(4)

-- Derive the points from the ideal for completeness
-- decompose returns the prime components (points) of the ideal

-- Define a Star Configuration of 6 lines
-- Star configurations of s lines in P^2 are known to have resurgence rho = (s-1)/2
-- For s=6, this gives a resurgence of 2.5, significantly higher than the Fermat configuration

-- Define 6 generic linear forms using a Vandermonde-like structure
-- The coefficients (1, t, t^2) ensure that any 3 lines are linearly independent (Vandermonde determinant)
-- Thus no 3 lines are concurrent, forming a proper star configuration
lines = apply(0..5, t -> x + t*y + t^2*z)

-- The configuration consists of the pairwise intersection points of these 6 lines
-- There are binomial(6,2) = 15 points
-- We construct the ideal as the intersection of these point ideals
