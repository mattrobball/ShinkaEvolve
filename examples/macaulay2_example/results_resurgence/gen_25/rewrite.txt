-- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
-- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
--
-- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
-- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
-- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence

-- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
-- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
-- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

R = QQ[x,y,z]

-- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
-- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
-- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
-- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
-- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence
fermatIdeal = (n) -> (
    ideal(
        x*(y^n - z^n),
        y*(z^n - x^n),
        z*(x^n - y^n)
    )
)

-- Instantiate the configuration with n=4
-- This defines a set of 19 points in P^2 (3 coordinate points + 16 points with non-zero coordinates)
-- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^4=y^4, y^4=z^4, z^4=x^4
I = fermatIdeal(4)

-- Derive the points from the ideal for completeness
-- decompose returns the prime components (points) of the ideal
