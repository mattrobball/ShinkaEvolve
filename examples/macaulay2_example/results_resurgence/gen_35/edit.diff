 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence
 
 R = QQ[x,y,z]
 
--- Define a line arrangement consisting of a 3x3 grid plus diagonals
--- The polynomial F defines the union of 8 lines:
--- x=0, x=z, x=-z (from x^3-xz^2)
--- y=0, y=z, y=-z (from y^3-yz^2)
--- y=x, y=-x      (from x^2-y^2)
-F = (x^3 - x*z^2) * (y^3 - y*z^2) * (x^2 - y^2)
+-- We construct a configuration of 7 points.
+-- First, the 6 vertices of a complete quadrilateral (Star Configuration of 4 lines).
+-- The lines are x, y, z, x+y+z.
+-- Vertices:
+-- V1=(0:0:1), V2=(1:-1:0)  (on x+y=0)
+-- V3=(0:1:0), V4=(1:0:-1)  (on x+z=0)
+-- V5=(1:0:0), V6=(0:1:-1)  (on y+z=0)
+--
+-- We add the intersection of the diagonals x+y=0 and x+z=0.
+-- P7 = (-1:1:1).
+-- This point is collinear with V1,V2 and V3,V4.
 
--- The singular locus of this arrangement consists of points where >= 2 lines intersect
--- High multiplicity intersections (up to 4 lines at the origin) drive up resurgence
--- We calculate the Jacobian ideal
-J = ideal(diff(x,F), diff(y,F), diff(z,F))
+pts = {
+    ideal(x, y),           -- (0:0:1)
+    ideal(x+y, z),         -- (1:-1:0)
+    ideal(x, z),           -- (0:1:0)

+    ideal(y, z),           -- (1:0:0)

--- We obtain the ideal of the points by taking the radical of the Jacobian
--- In this case, we decompose to find the prime ideals of the points and intersect them
--- This ensures I is the radical ideal of the configuration
-pts = decompose J
