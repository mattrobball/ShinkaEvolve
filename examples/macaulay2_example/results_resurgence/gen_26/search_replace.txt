<DESCRIPTION>
Replace the star configuration with the singular locus of the B3 reflection arrangement. This configuration consists of 13 points with varying multiplicities (intersections of 4, 3, and 2 lines). The high multiplicities and symmetry of this arrangement are expected to yield a higher resurgence than the simple star configuration.

R = QQ[x,y,z]

-- Define the ideal of a point configuration
-- Using a Star Configuration of 4 generic lines in P^2
-- The star configuration of s lines has resurgence (s-1)/(s-2)
-- For s=4, resurgence is 1.5, which should produce containment failures for m/r < 1.5
L = {x, y, z, x+y+z}
pts = flatten apply(4, i -> apply(i, j -> ideal(L#i, L#j)))

-- The ideal I is the intersection of the point ideals

R = QQ[x,y,z]

-- Define the ideal of a point configuration
-- Using the singular locus of the B3 reflection arrangement (9 lines)
-- Lines: x, y, z, x+/-y, x+/-z, y+/-z
-- This arrangement creates points with high multiplicity (up to 4 lines intersecting)
-- Such configurations (rational points of high multiplicity arrangements) often have high resurgence
