 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence
 
 R = QQ[x,y,z]
 
 -- Define the ideal of a point configuration
--- Using a Star Configuration of 4 generic lines in P^2
--- The star configuration of s lines has resurgence (s-1)/(s-2)
--- For s=4, resurgence is 1.5, which should produce containment failures for m/r < 1.5
