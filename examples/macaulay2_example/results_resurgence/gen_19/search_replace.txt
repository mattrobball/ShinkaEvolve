star_config_5_lines
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Implement a star configuration of 5 generic lines in P^2, which defines 10 points. This configuration has a theoretical resurgence of 1.6, which allows for containment failures such as I^(3) not in I^2 (ratio 1.5 < 1.6). Critically, the ideal is constructed using the known generators for star configurations (products of d-1 forms), ensuring the ideal is the radical ideal of the points, unlike the previous Jacobian-based approach which may have produced non-radical ideals or incorrect schemes.

-- Star configuration of 6 lines in P^2
-- The points are the pairwise intersections of 6 generic lines.
-- This configuration (15 points) is known to have resurgence 2(6-1)/6 = 5/3 approx 1.67,
-- which is higher than the 1.5 of the Fermat configuration.

-- Define 6 generic linear forms.
-- We use coefficients based on powers to ensure no three lines intersect at a point (genericity).
L = {
    x,
    y,
    z,
    x + y + z,
    x + 2*y + 4*z,
    x + 3*y + 9*z
}

-- The polynomial defining the union of the lines
F = product L

-- The ideal of the singular locus of the line arrangement.
-- For a generic arrangement, the singular locus consists exactly of the double points (intersections).
-- This ideal is generated by the partial derivatives of F.
I = ideal(jacobian(ideal(F)))

-- Decompose to get the individual point ideals (useful for verification)
