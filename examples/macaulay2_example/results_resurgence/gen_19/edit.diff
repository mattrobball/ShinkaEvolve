 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

--- Star configuration of 6 lines in P^2
--- The points are the pairwise intersections of 6 generic lines.
--- This configuration (15 points) is known to have resurgence 2(6-1)/6 = 5/3 approx 1.67,
--- which is higher than the 1.5 of the Fermat configuration.
+-- Star configuration of 5 lines in P^2
+-- The points are the pairwise intersections of 5 generic lines.
+-- This configuration (10 points) has resurgence 2(5-1)/5 = 1.6.
+-- This allows for containment failures (e.g., 3/2 < 1.6).
