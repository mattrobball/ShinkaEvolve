 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties

 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence

--- Function to generate Fermat-type ideals for a given degree n
--- This constructs the ideal defining the singular locus of a Fermat-like arrangement
--- Specifically, the ideal is generated by cyclically symmetric polynomials
--- For n=3, this recovers the dual Hesse configuration (12 points, resurgence >= 1.5)
--- For higher n, we expect different geometric properties and potentially higher resurgence

+-- Star Configuration of lines in P^2
+-- A star configuration of codimension 2 defined by s linear forms L_1, ..., L_s
+-- consists of the binom(s,2) points of intersection.
+-- The ideal is generated by the products of s-1 forms: I = (F_1, ..., F_s)
+-- where F_i = product_{j != i} L_j.
+-- Resurgence is known to be 2(s-1)/s.
+-- For s=7, rho = 12/7 approx 1.714.
 
--- Instantiate the configuration with n=4
--- This defines a set of 19 points in P^2 (3 coordinate points + 16 points with non-zero coordinates)
--- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^4=y^4, y^4=z^4, z^4=x^4
