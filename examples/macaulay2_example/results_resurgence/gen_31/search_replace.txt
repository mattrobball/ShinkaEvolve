The goal is to maximize the resurgence $\rho(I)$ of a point configuration in $\mathbb{P}^2$. The current best solution uses a Fermat configuration with $\rho(I) \approx 1.5$.

I propose to use a **Star Configuration** of points. A star configuration formed by $s$ generic lines in $\mathbb{P}^2$ consists of the $\binom{s}{2}$ pairwise intersection points of these lines. The ideal $I$ of such a configuration is generated by the products of $s-1$ of the linear forms.
It is a known result that the resurgence of a star configuration of $s$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{P}^n$ (here $n=2$) is given by $\rho(I) = \frac{n(s-1)}{s+n-1-c}$ where $c$ is the codimension.
For points in $\mathbb{P}^2$ formed by lines, this formula simplifies (or is known) to be $\rho(I) = \frac{2(s-1)}{s}$.

We choose $s=7$.
The expected resurgence is $\rho(I) = \frac{2(6)}{7} = \frac{12}{7} \approx 1.714$.
This is significantly higher than 1.5. The number of points is $\binom{7}{2} = 21$, which is computationally feasible (comparable to the 19 points of the Fermat $n=4$ case).

To ensure the lines are in general position (no three concurrent), we use linear forms defined by Vandermonde vectors $(1, t, t^2)$, i.e., $L_t = x + ty + t^2z$. The condition that 3 lines intersect at a point corresponds to the determinant of their coefficients being zero. Since the Vandermonde determinant is non-zero for distinct $t$, no three lines will be concurrent.

<DESCRIPTION>
I will implement a generator for a Star Configuration of points in $\mathbb{P}^2$ using 7 lines in general position.
A star configuration of $s$ lines has a resurgence of $\rho(I) = \frac{2(s-1)}{s}$.
For $s=7$, this yields $\rho = 12/7 \approx 1.714$, which is significantly higher than the $\rho=1.5$ of the Fermat configuration.
I will use lines of the form $x + ty + t^2z$ (Vandermonde rows) to ensure that no three lines are concurrent (General Position), guaranteeing the configuration consists of exactly $\binom{7}{2}=21$ double points.
