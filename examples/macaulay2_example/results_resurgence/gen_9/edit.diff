 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence
 
-R = QQ[x,y]
+R = QQ[x,y,z]
 
 -- Define the ideal of a point configuration
--- Starting with a simple configuration - evolution should find better ones
--- Example: 4 points forming a square
+-- Using points of multiplicity >= 3 from the B3 arrangement (signed permutations)
+-- These 7 points are highly special (intersections of 4 lines each from the arrangement)
