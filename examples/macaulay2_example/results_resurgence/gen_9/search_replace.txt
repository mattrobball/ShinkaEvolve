<DESCRIPTION>
Change the point configuration to the set of points of multiplicity >= 3 in the B3 hyperplane arrangement (singular locus). This configuration consists of 7 points in projective plane: the 3 coordinate points and 4 points of the form (+/-1 : +/-1 : 1). These points are intersections of 4 lines each in the arrangement, providing a highly non-generic structure expected to have higher resurgence than a simple square.

R = QQ[x,y]

-- Define the ideal of a point configuration
-- Starting with a simple configuration - evolution should find better ones
-- Example: 4 points forming a square
pts = {
    ideal(x, y),           -- origin
    ideal(x-1, y),         -- (1,0)
    ideal(x, y-1),         -- (0,1)
    ideal(x-1, y-1)        -- (1,1)
}

-- The ideal I is the intersection of the point ideals
I = intersect pts

-- Define the ideal of a point configuration
-- Using points of multiplicity >= 3 from the B3 arrangement (signed permutations)
-- These 7 points are highly special (intersections of 4 lines each from the arrangement)
pts = {

    ideal(x, y),            -- (0:0:1)
    ideal(x-y, y-z),        -- (1:1:1)
    ideal(x+y, y+z),        -- (1:-1:1)
    ideal(x+y, y-z),        -- (-1:1:1)
    ideal(x-y, y+z)         -- (1:1:-1) equivalent to (-1:-1:1)
