star_configuration_4_lines
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
I propose replacing the current point configuration (a subset of the B3 arrangement) with a **Star Configuration of 4 generic lines** in $\mathbb{P}^2$.

The Star Configuration of $s$ lines has a known resurgence of $\rho(I) = \frac{s-1}{s-2}$.
For $s=4$, the resurgence is $1.5$.
This configuration is theoretically superior to generic points ($\rho=1$) and likely better than the current subset of B3 which showed a lower bound of 1.0.
Specifically, with $\rho=1.5$, we expect to observe containment failures for pairs $(m,r)$ where $m/r < 1.5$.
For example, the containment $I^{(4)} \subseteq I^3$ (ratio 1.33) is expected to fail, whereas in the previous run it held. Observing this failure will increase the `resurgence_lower_bound` metric from 1.0 to at least 1.33.
The code generates the ideal of the 6 intersection points of the 4 lines $x, y, z, x+y+z$.
