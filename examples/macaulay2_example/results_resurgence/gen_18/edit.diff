 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties
 --
 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence
 
 R = QQ[x,y,z]
 
--- Define the ideal of a point configuration
--- Using points of multiplicity >= 3 from the B3 arrangement (signed permutations)
--- These 7 points are highly special (intersections of 4 lines each from the arrangement)

+-- Algorithmic approach: Construct a Star Configuration of 6 lines.

+-- Such configurations are known to maximize containment failures and resurgence.
+-- We use lines L_t dual to points on a rational normal curve to ensure general position.
