 -- Resurgence optimization: find point configurations with large resurgence
 -- The ideal I defined here will be evaluated for its resurgence properties

 -- Resurgence rho(I) = sup{m/r : I^(m) not contained in I^r}
 -- For generic points, resurgence is close to 1
 -- Special configurations (Fermat points, star configurations) can have larger resurgence
 
 -- EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
 -- Define points in affine 2-space (or projective 2-space)
 -- The evolution should find point configurations with high resurgence

--- Define the ideal of a point configuration
--- Using points of multiplicity >= 3 from the B3 arrangement (signed permutations)
--- These 7 points are highly special (intersections of 4 lines each from the arrangement)

+-- This ensures the lines are generic (no 3 concurrent) because the determinant of any 3
+-- coefficient vectors is a non-zero Vandermonde determinant.
+-- For 7 lines, we get Binomial(7,2) = 21 points.
