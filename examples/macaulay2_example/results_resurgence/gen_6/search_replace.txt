<DESCRIPTION>
I propose changing the point configuration to a "Star Configuration" formed by 6 lines in $\mathbb{P}^2$ in general position.

Reasoning:
1.  **High Resurgence:** Star configurations (intersections of $s$ hyperplanes taken $c$ at a time) are known to have high resurgence. For points in $\mathbb{P}^2$ formed by $s$ generic lines, the resurgence is expected to be higher than that of the Fermat configuration (which corresponds to a specific arrangement related to $s=9$ but with triple points).
2.  **Targeted Failure:** With $s=6$ lines, we expect to find containment failures such as $I^{(5)} \not\subseteq I^3$, which gives a ratio of $5/3 \approx 1.67$. This is greater than the $1.5$ ratio ($I^{(3)} \not\subseteq I^2$) obtained from the Fermat configuration.
3.  **Robustness:** By defining the ideal as the intersection of all pairwise intersections of 6 specific lines in general position, we guarantee a radical ideal of 15 distinct points.
4.  **Generality:** Using generic integer coefficients for the lines ensures we avoid accidental symmetries or triple points that might lower the resurgence or alter the expected behavior of a generic star configuration.

The ideal is constructed by intersecting the $\binom{6}{2}=15$ ideals of the points where each pair of lines meets.

-- The Fermat configuration of 12 points in P^2
-- These are the intersection points of the lines defined by x^3-y^3, y^3-z^3, z^3-x^3
-- This configuration is known to provide a counterexample to I^(3) <= I^2
I = ideal(
    x*(y^3-z^3),
    y*(z^3-x^3),

R = QQ[x,y,z]

-- Star configuration of 6 lines in P^2
-- Defined as the set of pairwise intersections of 6 lines in general position.
-- This yields 15 points.
-- Star configurations are known to exhibit high resurgence.
-- For s lines, resurgence is often related to ratios involving s.
-- With s=6, we target containment failures like I^(5) not in I^3 (ratio 1.66).

-- Define 6 lines in general position (using coefficients to ensure no triple points)

    x,
    y,
    z,
    x + y + z,
    x - y + z,

}

-- The ideal I of a star configuration is the intersection of the ideals of all pairs of lines.
-- There are binomial(6,2) = 15 such points.
-- We compute I as the intersection of these pair ideals.
